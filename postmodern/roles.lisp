;; Per the Postgresql Documentation, CREATE ROLE adds a new role to a PostgreSQL
;; database cluster. A role is an entity that can own database objects and have
;; database privileges; a role can be considered a “user”, a “group”, or both
;; depending on how it is used.
;; https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html. The only real
;; difference between "create role" and "create user" is that create user
;; defaults to having a login attribute and create role defaults to not having
;;a login attribute.

;; Pre-Postgresql version 8.1, groups and users were distinct kinds of entities.
;; Roles have replaced that and can operate as either. Often applications will
;; have their own concept of users and the application will itself have one or
;; more types of roles to which the application user is assigned. So, for
;; example, the application may have two roles - reader and editor with which
;; it interacts with postgresql and then there are many application users
;; registered with the application and probably listed in some type of user
;; table in postgresql that the application manages. When users 1,2 or 3 log in
;; to the application, the application might connect to the postgresql cluster
;; using a role that only has read (select) permissions. When users 4 or 5 log
;; in to the application, the applicatin might connect to the postgresql cluster
;; using a role that has read, insert, update and delete permission. Postmodern
;; provides a simplified create-role system allowing easy creation of roles that
;; have readonly, editor or superuser type permissions. Further, those
;; permissions can be limited to individual databases, schemas or tables.

;; You really want to separate application users from roles. Make it easy to
;; drop application users. Dropping roles requires going through every database,
;; reassigning ownership of any objects that role might own or have privileges
;; on, then dropping ownership of objects, then dropping the role itself.

CREATE ROLE myapp_readonly;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE defaultdb TO myapp_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA myapp TO myapp_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "myapp"."employees" TO myapp_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "myapp"."jobs" TO myapp_readonly;
GRANT SELECT (id, name) ON TABLE myapp.customers TO myapp_readonly;
CREATE USER redash WITH PASSWORD 'secret';
GRANT myapp_readonly TO redash;

Variation?
CREATE ROLE xxx LOGIN PASSWORD 'yyy';
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO xxx;

This only affects tables that have already been created. More powerfully, you
can automatically have default roles assigned to new objects in future:

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO xxx;

Variation?
-- Create a group
CREATE ROLE readaccess;

-- Grant access to existing tables
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readaccess;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readaccess;

-- Grant access to future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readaccess;

-- Create a final user with password
CREATE USER tomek WITH PASSWORD 'secret';
GRANT readaccess TO tomek;

-- Revoke ability to create tables

    REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM public
    GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO writeuser

Hi there are four databases present in this server. When i create this user,
that user can create tables in different databases. I want to restrict that too.

Variation?
CREATE USER readonly  WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'readonly';
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public to readonly;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;

-- repeat code below for each database:

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE foo to readonly;
\c foo
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;
--- this grants privileges on new tables generated in new database "foo"
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public to readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;

Notes:
In PostgreSQL, every connection is to a particular database, and nearly
everything you run has effect only within that one database. (One exception is
that creation of users/roles themselves is global to the entire "cluster",
i.e. running Postgres server.)

In the psql commands you show, you are connecting the first time without
specifying a database (psql), which connects you to a database named after the
current system user, which is postgres. This is shown at the beginning of the
psql prompt: postgres=# (the # shows that you are connected as a supersuser).


-----------------------
n PostgreSQL*, you cannot drop a database while clients are connected to it.

At least, not with the dropdb utility - which is only a simple wrapper around
DROP DATABASE server query.

Quite robust workaround follows:

Connect to your server as superuser, using psql or other client. Do not use the
database you want to drop.

psql -h localhost postgres postgres

Now using plain database client you can force drop database using three simple
steps:

    Make sure no one can connect to this database. You can use one of following
methods (the second seems safer, but does not prevent connections from
superusers).

    /* Method 1: update system catalog */
    UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = 'false' WHERE datname = 'mydb';

    /* Method 2: use ALTER DATABASE. Superusers still can connect!
    ALTER DATABASE mydb CONNECTION LIMIT 0; */

    Force disconnection of all clients connected to this database, using
pg_terminate_backend.

    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE datname = 'mydb';

    /* For old versions of PostgreSQL (up to 9.1), change pid to procpid:

    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(procpid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE datname = 'mydb'; */

    Drop the database.

    DROP DATABASE mydb;

Step 1 requires superuser privileges for the 1st method, and database owner
privileges for the 2nd one. Step 2 requires superuser privileges. Step 3
requires database owner privilege.

 :databases defaults to :current but can be a list of databases. User will not

 :allow-whitespace - Whitespace in either the name or password is not allowed by
default.

 :allow-utf8 defaults to nil. If t, the name and password will be normalized. If
nil, the name and password are limited to printable ascii characters. For fun
reading on utf8 user names see
https://labs.spotify.com/2013/06/18/creative-usernames. Also interesting reading
is https://github.com/flurdy/bad_usernames and https://github.com/dsignr/disallowed-usernames/blob/master/disallowed%20usernames.csv,

 :allow-disallowed-names defaults to nil. If nil, the user name will be checked
against *disallowed-user-names*.

 As an aside, if allowing utf8 in names, you might want to think about whether
you should second copy of the username in the original casing and normalized as
NFC for display purposes as opposed to normalizing to NFKC. It might be viewed
as culturally insensitive to change the display of the name."

Notes:
Every connection is specific to a particular database. However, creating roles
or users is global to the entire cluster (the running postgresql server). You
can create policies for any individual database, schema or table, but you need
to ensure that those policies also apply to any subsequently created database,
schema or table. Note that each user is automatically a member of the public
group, so you need to change those policies for public as well.

Option for limiting user name and password to ascii, otherwise normalize both.

Do we need to implement confusables? See http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/

Do we want to throw an error if whitespace in user name or password?
Do we want to throw an error if role already exists (after normalizing and with
equalp?

How to handle confusables?
https://confusable-homoglyphs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html


CREATE ROLE xxx LOGIN PASSWORD 'yyy';
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO xxx;

This only affects tables that have already been created. More powerfully, you
can automatically have default roles assigned to new objects in future:

* alter default privileges in schema public grant select on tables to xxx;


Variation?


-- repeat code below for each database:

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE foo to readonly;
\c foo
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;
--- this grants privileges on new tables generated in new database "foo"
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public to readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;

-- Find objects with owner X
