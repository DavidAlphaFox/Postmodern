;;;; Postmodern transactions with isolation levels and RO, RW
;;;; settings plus serialization failure handling.

;;; The following adds support for setting the isolation level of a
;;; Postmodern transaction, and setting the read only or read write
;;; status of that transaction at the same time. See
;;; http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-set-transaction.html

;;; There is also support for a rudimentary retry loop to catch the
;;; cl-postgres-error:serialization-failure conditions that may arise
;;; when using 'repeatable read' or 'serializable' isolation levels.
;;; Since 'read committed' is the default isolation level, many
;;; Postgres users will never have seen such failures.  Postgres-JSON
;;; requires either of the above isolation levels because of, say,
;;; SUPERSEDE keeping a full history under the covers...

;;; A small change to Postmodern is required to support these
;;; additions, see postgres/postmodern.lisp
